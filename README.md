## 🌱 Overview

*Dice of Six* is an idle dice-rolling game that combines resource management and build strategy.  
The game is designed for long-term progression and synergy-based gameplay rather than fast completion.

This project represents an ongoing, self-developed title under **nomnom studio**, demonstrating consistent software development.

## 🎓 Origin & Purpose

*Dice of Six* originated from academic coursework completed at **California State University, Northridge (CSUN)**,  
specifically from **COMP565 – Advanced Computer Graphics** and **COMP485 – Human-Computer Interaction**,  
instructed by **Professor Vahe Karamian**. The project began as a practical application of my studies in **Computer Science**,  
combining system design, UI/UX, and computational logic into an original interactive product.

Following graduation, the project evolved into a **self-employment venture** under **Post-OPT**,  
operating as an independent business entity (**nomnom studio**).  
This structure enables continuous application of academic knowledge to real-world development,  
fulfilling the OPT requirement of engaging in professional training directly related to my field of study.

The business plan includes clear objectives, a revenue model, and a long-term roadmap toward a commercial release on Steam.  
All development is documented through verifiable commit history, daily work logs, and tangible deliverables,  
ensuring that this activity is a legitimate, structured business rather than a personal hobby.

By pursuing this work in the United States, I benefit from proximity to global distribution platforms,  
hardware and software innovation networks, and potential investment opportunities —  
supporting both personal professional growth and the creation of a sustainable entertainment product.
