## 🎓 Origin & Purpose

The foundation of *Dice of Six* stems from coursework completed a 
**California State University, Northridge (CSUN)** — particularly
**COMP565: Advanced Computer Graphics** and **COMP485: Human-Computer Interaction**
instructed by **Professor Vahe Karamian**.

The project extends these academic principles into a practical business application,
focusing on **interactive systems**, **UI/UX design**, and **computational logic**
within a commercially viable software product.

The business plan includes clear objectives, a revenue model, and a long-term roadmap toward a commercial release on Steam.
All development is documented through verifiable commit history, daily work logs, and tangible deliverables,
ensuring that this activity is a legitimate, structured business rather than a personal hobby.

By pursuing this work in the United States, I benefit from proximity to global distribution platforms,
hardware and software innovation networks, and potential investment opportunities —
supporting both personal professional growth and the creation of a sustainable entertainment product.
