## 🎓 Origin & Purpose

industry-leading tools, digital distribution platforms, and innovation networks essential for global release.  
In turn, the project contributes to the U.S. creative economy by fostering independent software production,  
and strengthening the presence of small-scale digital entertainment businesses within the U.S. market.
